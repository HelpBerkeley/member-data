If not, ask.\n  * Cafe Raj, Noodle Fresh, and Talavera sometimes forget\n* remember that some consumers may order from more than one restaurant. They are listed in your form above\n* remember to call consumers, after dropping off, from your car while parked on the street next to their house\n* remember to discard gloves, sanitize box, and thoroughly wash hands when coming home\n* **remember to upload right away the delivery forms by replying to this thread: we are waiting for them to start laying out tomorrow’s driver runs.**\n* Please write up a quick post of what did not go well, and suggestions on how to prepare the runs better. Let us know when you completed your run."
