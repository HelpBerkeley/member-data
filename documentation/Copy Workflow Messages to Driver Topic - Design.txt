        1.1 Driver Messages Request with Target Topic


A dispatcher posts a request either to the “Request driver messages” topic or the “Request OneKitchen driver messages” topic with an uploaded routed deliveries sheet along with an optional argument for a target topic to copy the messages to. If the optional argument “Topic: [TOPIC_URL]” is provided, messages will not be posted to the standard “Get driver messages” topic and will instead go directly to the target topic.
        


DES-WMD-001-1 Support optional argument


Support optional “Topic: TOPIC_URL” argument in driver message request topics. TOPIC_URL must correspond to an existing topic in the Driver->Deliveries subcategory. Design should allow for typos including capitalization differences, removal of the colon, and extra whitespace within the “Topic: “ keyword. The only constraint for the topic URL is that it must contain the numeric topic ID. It may optionally contain a specific post number, which will be ignored.


DES-WMD-001-2 Message ownership transfer


Transfer ownership of all generated messages posted in target topic to the dispatcher who requested it. 


DES-WMD-001-3 Status messages


In case of failure, support relevant error messages to message requester in closet topic.


New error messages would include:
1. “Target topic not found, please check that your specified topic URL is correct, and try again.”
2. “Target topic is not in the Drivers>Deliveries subcategory. Please check that the target topic is in the Drivers>Deliveries subcategory, and try again.”




In case of success, the standard success message for “Request driver messages” request should be posted to the request topic with a change that reads:
“Messages Posted to [name of target topic with link to first driver messages post] under the name of [message requester].”
