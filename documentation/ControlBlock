The control block is a section at the beginning of a workflow table that
is used to version the schema of the workflow data provide macro support
for driver message generation.

A workflow table can contain 0 or 1 control blocks.
(Workflow sheets without a control block are only supported for
processing historical consumer order data that pre-dates the
addition of control block support).

The control block can only appear as the first section of the table.

Rows within control block will have the same number of columns as the
rest of the workflow table.

All rows within the control block must have FALSE in the
Consumer and Driver columns.

Empty rows within a control block will be ignored:
    FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The control block will have explicit beginning and ending marker rows, with the marker being in the Name column:
    Consumer,Driver,Name,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    FALSE,FALSE,ControlBegin,,,,,,,,,,,,
    FALSE,FALSE,ControlEnd,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rows within the control block which contain the Comment directive in
the Name column will be ignored.

Data rows within the control block support a single key/value pair per row.
The key name is in the User Name column and the key value is in the City column:

    Consumer,Driver,Name,User Name,EMail,Phone #,Phone2,Neighborhood,,,,,,,,
    FALSE,FALSE,,BackupDriverUserName,,,,ReplaceThisByTheBackUpDriverUserName,,,,,,,,,

The key value pair may also define a 2-uplet or an n-uplet. When that is so:
    the key syntax will be CompositeVariable (Variable1 | Variable2 |…| Variable N)
    The value syntax will be Value1 | Value 2 | … | Value N

The default of any value will always be pre-filled to start with the
string ReplaceThis in order to allow for detection of unfilled variables

There may be zero or more data rows within a control block.

Data row keys are well known (tied to being supported by a specific
version of the control block).

Support version 2-0-0 keys are:

    Version
    OpsManager (UserName | Phone)
    SplitRestaurant (Name | CleanupDriverUserName)
    BackupDriverUserName
