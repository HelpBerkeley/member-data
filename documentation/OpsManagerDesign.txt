1.  Control Block


Design details: https://github.com/HelpBerkeley/member-data/blob/master/documentation/ControlBlock




1.1 Supported Uses


Post workflow table with control block to one of Request Driver Messages threads on helpberkeley.org -> receive driver messages output on Get Driver Messages thread.




DES-CB-001-1 HBFreeDeliveries Template - Operations Manager


Workflow table template should specify: “There are two possible syntaxes---one without a phone number, and one with a phone number (the separator between the name and the number is a specific separator: | ). Examples of each are: 
OpsManager (UserName) – example
OpsManager (UserName | Phone) – example” 


Template default value should read “OpsManager (UserName)” instead of “OpsManager (UserName | Phone)” - to be replaced by user.


DES-CB-001-2 Operations Manager Macro


“OpsManager (UserName)” macro is used in the Control Block to specify the identity of OpsManager, and their phone number, in the generated driver messages. “OpsManager (UserName | Phone)” and “OpsManager (UserName)” should both work with the same functionality.
