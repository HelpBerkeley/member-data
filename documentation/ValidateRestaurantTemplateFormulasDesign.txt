        Validate Restaurant Template Formulas Design
Version number: 1.4
Author: David Stone, Cameron Thouati


Requirements addressed from Validate Restaurant Template Formulas Requirements:
* REQ-VRT-001-1 Validate formulas in OneKitchen Restaurant Template
* REQ-VRT-001-2 Validate formulas in regular Restaurant Template
* REQ-VRT-001-3 Error reporting


Background:


        The software checks regularly (currently every 80 seconds)
        for restaurant template updates posted to these topics on go.helpberkeley.org:
            * Post Restaurant Template for Driver Messages
               * https://go.helpberkeley.org/t/post-restaurant-template-for-driver-messages/1860/
            * Post Restaurant Template for OneKitchen Driver Messages
               * https://go.helpberkeley.org/t/post-restaurant-template-for-onekitchen-driver-messages/6548/




        The first line of a post must have only the date for the completed
        daily orders in the form YYYY/MM/DD


        Followed on another line by the uploaded spreadsheet. The software
        validates the date and the restaurant template data and responds
        either with a status message indicating success or the reason
        for failure.


        Lines other than the date and upload link are ignored, and may
        be added for documentation purposes


        When a new template is seen, the software checks that it
        is well formed and parses correctly, and if so, stores it
        in a SoftwareStore topic for use in workflow request processing.
        A success message is posted as a reply on the request thread.
        Note that the SoftwareStore category is meant to be private to
        the software.


        If the template has problems, it is rejected and the errors are
        reported as a reply in the request thread.


    Formula validations:

        Control block lines that are to be ignored contain “Comment” (case-insensitive) in the Name column.
        A new indicator - “Formula” (case-insensitive) - will be used in the Name column for all rows that contain a formula.


        The presence of "Formula" indicators is generally optional, but is required for templates posted to the following threads:
        * https://go.helpberkeley.org/t/post-restaurant-template-for-driver-messages/1860/
        * https://go.helpberkeley.org/t/post-restaurant-template-for-onekitchen-driver-messages/6548/
        If the "Formula" indicator is missing from templates posted to the above threads, an error will be reported as a
        reply to the thread with the text “No Formula rows found within the Control Block.  At least one valid Formula row is required.”


        Rows marked by the "Formula" indicator must contain at least one value beginning with ‘= or an error will be
        reported as a reply to the post thread: "Invalid or missing Formula value found at line N. Formula values must
        begin with '= or they will not import/export correctly."


    Template version number:

        The new OneKitchen Restaurant templates will have version number 3-0-2, and the formula validation feature will
        be backwards compatible with template versions 3-0-0 and above.


        The new regular Restaurant templates will have version number 2-0-2, and the formula validation feature will be
        backwards compatible with template versions 2-0-0 and above.
