Automated Driver's Run Post Design
Version 1.0.7

Motivation
==========

The per driver delivery run posting is generated
daily, manually, by cutting and pasting many different
blocks of existing data from the workflow spreadsheet.
This process is laborious and can be error prone.

The algorithm for generating the driver's run posting is
fixed and mechanical, and as such, lends itself to automation.

Automated Work Flow Overview
============================

Look for posts in a fixed topic that contain
uploaded, routed, workflow data.

For each post that hasn't yet been processed
 - Generate the per driver, run posts.
 - Post the driver run posts
 - Update the workflow post, marking it as having been
   processed.

 Or, if there are any errors

 - Update the workflow post with information
   about the errors encountered. No driver
   run posts will be done if there are any
   errors during the generation phase.
 - Update the workflow post, marking it as having been
   processed.


Looking for routed workflow posts
=================================

Routed workflow data will be looked for in
a topic called "Routed Workflow Data".

Between the hours of 1900 and 0100 (next day) this topic will be checked
every 3 minutes for unprocessed posts.

Format for routed workflow posts
================================

YYYY/MM/DD
Upload link to routed workflow data. 

Format for processing status appended by back-end
=================================================

Status: Succeeded
Driver Run Posts:
	${DRIVER_NAME} : URL
	...

OR

Status: Failed
${ERROR_MESSAGE}

Driver's Run Post
=================

1) Definition

Consists of one section per post, from the thread:
https://go.helpberkeley.org/t/automated-post-formatting-1-drivers-run/1967

The first post is a control post: it defines the content of the rest of the thread, and none of its 
content should be used as a template for the generated driver's run post.

2) Variable types

Two types of substitution variables are supported.
  * Simple. Support single value. Simple variable variable names
    may only contain capital letters and underscores.
  * Composite. Contain a list identifier and a variable name, separated by a dot.
    Example: RESTAURANT.NAME
    List identifiers imply iteration through all matching rows in the corresponding driver data.
    A section may only use a single list identifier, by may contain multiple variables contained
    by the list type.
    EXAMPLE: ${RESTAURANT.NAME} ${RESTAURANT.ADDRESS}

3) Explicit rules

The following explicit rules are used:
  * one post will be written for each driver's block in the spreadsheet
  * Each section should be followed by a blank line. The original format of the post should be kept.
  * Every time a composite variable is used, it should be iterated through all
    instances  in the driver's block. If in a table, each table line should be an iteration.

    [If in a conditional block boolean variable, each conditional block should be an iteration.

    FIX THIS: not clear what this means.  reword, add example.
    I am not quite sure what I meant :-) ]

    [In an enumeration, the enumeration should cover all items. For instance, a RESTAURANT composite
    variable should be iterated through all dedicated restaurant lines in the driver's block.

    FIX THIS: what does enumeration mean here?  The same as iteration above?
    It is very poorly written. The enumeration was for the list of drivers, originally. But the example
is for the restaurant matrix. I am not quite sure how to fix this until we have more syntax discussion]

  * By default, the order in which a table of composite variables should be output is in the order
    of the driver's block.
  * A label should not be output. A label is always alone on its own line, and always surrounded
    by brackets. For instance, the first line of the second post is [header]: it is a label.
  * A variable should be indicated by the following syntax: ${VARIABLE_NAME}. THe only variables that
    will be rendered are those listed in the Variable section below.
  * The syntax for a conditional section should be as follows:
    IF ${BOOLEAN_VARIABLE} THEN {  [conditional block]  }

4) Special rules

4.1) CALCULATED_RESTAURANT_START_TIME 

* regardless of the number of orders, if RESTAURANT_START_TIME is before 5:00 PM for any restaurant on
the itinerary:
 POSSIBLE_RESTAURANT_START_TIME = RESTAURANT_START_TIME - p * 5 minutes where:
 p = number of restaurants on the itinerary before this restaurant
Then CALCULATED_RESTAURANT_START_TIME = min { set of POSSIBLE_RESTAURANT_START_TIME for all
 such restaurants}


If RESTAURANT_START_TIME is not before 5:00 PM for any restaurant on itinerary:
* If at least one restaurant has orders, then:
CALCULATED_RESTAURANT_START_TIME = RESTAURANT_START_TIME - p * 5 minutes
where:
 p = number of restaurants with 0 orders on the itinerary before the first restaurant with one or more orders
 RESTAURANT_START_TIME = that for the first restaurant with one or more orders on the itinerary
except that CALCULATED_RESTAURANT_START_TIME cannot be less than 5:00 PM
* If all restaurants on the itinerary have 0 orders, then
CALCULATED_RESTAURANT_START_TIME = 5:00PM

4.2 This restaurant closes at ${CLOSING_TIME}

PLease note that I added the appropriate logic in the Header section, with 3 additional variables in 
the variables table. I should not add the present section 4.2: I added it only to bring your attention
to the changes in the header section.


5) Variables

The following input variables may be used in a post:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE: we need the dispatcher info in the routed workflow sheet
      and a convention for how to distinguish it.
Note: the CONSUMER composite variable is sometimes shown as C.

6) Please note the following optional developments:

* the order of the Pickup matrix would, optionally, best follow the restaurant order rather than 
the deliveries order, since the driver will use it at pickup time. This is a minor option.

* We are now starting to share restaurants between drivers. We are using the following conditional
conditional block for that purpose:

"We are running an experiment:

* you are one of [# of drivers] drivers going to pick orders at RestaurantName [all drivers: @DriverName 
at DriverPhoneNumber; (iterated, no worries about last ;)]. The total number of orders is NOrders: you are 
picking up Porders of them.
* you are primary [secondary] driver for this restaurant, which means that **you need [do not need] to take 
pics** of the delivery form
* because several drivers are going to this restaurant, you need to be careful about what orders you are 
picking up
* if you are not the last driver picking up orders, please make sure you are picking up YOUR orders, 
and tell the restaurant that other drivers are coming.
* while you pick up your orders, please post on the thread to let other drivers know (so that the last 
driver knows she is last)
* if you are the last driver picking up orders, please make sure that there is no extra order."

Here is deterministic logic for determining who is primary driver (there can be several secondary drivers):
* The driver who arrives first (in order of restaurants in their list) at the split restaurant is primary;
* in case of ties, the driver with the smallest number of stops (restaurants + deliveries) is primary;
* in case of ties, the driver with the smallest number of restaurants is primary;
* in case of ties, the driver that comes first in username alphabetica order is primary.

[I am leaving this section in place because it is more readable than the other section below]
This is also deterministic information, all existing in the spreadsheet today.

[Header]

Driver's run for @${DRIVER}

**Please reply to this thread when you being your run!**
**Your run starts at ${FIRST_RESTAURANT} at ${CALCULATED_RESTAURANT_START_TIME}. IF ${CLOSING_EARLY} 
{ **This restaurant closes at ${CLOSING_TIME}.** }

Any problem, any issue: call or text @{DISPATCHER} ${DISPATCH_PHONE#}. They are a phone call/text away.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Split Restaurant]

IF ${ANY_SPLIT_RESTAURANT} THEN
{
FOR ${EACH_SPLIT_RESTAURANT}
{

FIX THIS TO MATCH description section above
* you are one of ${SPLIT_RESTAURANT.NUMBER_OF_DRIVERS} drivers going to pick orders at 
**${SPLIT_RESTAURANT.NAME}** [all drivers: FOR ${SPLIT_RESTAURANT.EACH_DRIVER}
{
@${SPLIT_RESTAURANT.DRIVER.NAME} at ${SPLIT_RESTAURANT.DRIVER.PHONE_NUMBER};
}
]. The total number of orders is ${SPLIT_RESTAURANT.TOTAL_ORDERS}: you are picking up 
${SPLIT_RESTAURANT.THIS_DRIVER.ORDERS} of them.
* you are IF {SPLIT_RESTAURANT.THIS_DRIVER.PRIMARY} {primary} ELSE {secondary} driver for this restaurant, 
which means that you IF {SPLIT_RESTAURANT.THIS_DRIVER.PRIMARY} {need} ELSE {do not need} to take pics 
of the delivery form
}

* because multiple drivers are going to the same restaurant, you need to be careful about what orders
 you are picking up
* if you are not the last driver picking up orders, please make sure you are picking YOUR orders, and 
tell the restaurant that other drivers are coming.
* while you pick up your orders, please post on the thread to let other drivers know (so that the last 
driver knows she is last)
* if you are the last driver picking up orders, please make sure that there is no extra order.

[Condo]

IF ${ANY_CONDO} THEN {  
You have a condo on your run! Please be aware we have special delivering instructions and they are:
**(1) Before departing the previous delivery destination, we MUST call the upcoming condo customer**
and let her know when we are due, and to wait at street level;
**(2)**  We do not walk up to the apartment/condo unit;
**(3)**  When you arrive, ask her to maintain a 6 ft distance if necessary,
leave the food a safe distance from the customer and walk away, wishing the customer a good day;
**(4)**  If she is not waiting when you arrive call again and wait three minutes;
**(5)**  If she is not down within three minutes (whether she ever picked up or not),
we leave the food bag in the lobby, otherwise at the lobby front door,
then we call again and explain that we left the food bag.}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Restaurants]

**Restaurants**

Please go to every restaurant, in the sequence listed below, even if there are no pickups, in order to take pictures of the delivery form for the next day.

[Tips]

Some tips–read carefully:

* First and foremost thank you for helping serve our COVID-vulnerable neighbors in Berkeley(plus)
* The Five Must-Haves: Well-charged phone, gloves, clean food boxes, mask, social distancing
* Before setting off, use your phone to open the email message you received for this run (it will save a cached version in the event you lose cellular connectivity during your run)
* when using static GMAP URL, you might need to press Continue to go from waypoint to waypoint
* **remember to arrive at the first restaurant on time**
* always take a pic in portrait mode (not landscape)
* remember to take 2 pictures of delivery form right when you arrive at the restaurant, to make sure there are no important missing parts to the pic
  * **Cafe Raj: make sure to ask them if the delivery form is tomorrow’s orders (rather than today)**
* make sure your pics include ALL THE INFO we need, including restaurant name at the top
* verify that all bags are labeled if there is more than one order. If not, ask.
  * Cafe Raj, Noodle Fresh, and Talavera sometimes forget
* remember that some consumers may order from more than one restaurant. They are listed in your form above
* remember to call consumers, after dropping off, from your car while parked on the street next to their house
* remember to discard gloves, sanitize box, and thoroughly wash hands when coming home
* **remember to upload right away the delivery forms by replying to this thread: we are waiting for them to start laying out tomorrow’s driver runs.**
* Please write up a quick post of what did not go well, and suggestions on how to prepare the runs better. Let us know when you completed your run.
