Order History Design
Version 2.0.0

Background
==========

The Customer Care InReach group requires historical consumer order data
that is not available in the Discourse user record. This data is available
in the completed daily dispatcher workflow spreadsheets.

See InReach consumer data in schemas.txt.

Requirements
============

Track additional consumer order information:
    - Total number of orders made
    - First order date
    - Most recent order date

Store data on Discourse (the general rule is that there should be
no data stored outside of Discourse).

Validate and accept or reject the workflow spreadsheets as they are posted by the workflow dispatchers.

Provide the ability to easily redo historical data.

Incoming data
=============

Workflow dispatchers submit a completed spreadsheet by replying to the "Post completed daily orders" topic.

The first line of the reply must be the date for the spreadsheet, in the following form:

    YYYY/MM/DD

For example:

    2021/01/23

The remaining part of the reply must contain a link to the uploaded spreadsheet.
The name of the spreadsheet does not matter.
Other text in the reply is ignored.

Example:

    2020/01/23
    [HelpBerkeleyDeliveries - 3_28.csv|attachment](upload://xyzzy.csv) (828 Bytes)

If the date in the reply matches an existing date that was previously posted, the spreadsheet for
that date will be replaced in the historical data.

Validation of incoming data
===========================

After a spreadsheet is posted, the back-end software will see it within a minute or two, and post a
status message stating either that the spreadsheet was accepted, or what it wasn't and what
needs to be corrected.

This message will be of the form:

    Status: Accepted (or Rejected)
    Date: YYYY/MM/DD

If the spreadsheet was rejected there will be addition lines describing why
and what needs to be fixed.

The workflow dispatcher should wait for this status message to be posted,
and if the spreadsheet was rejected, correct it and resubmit.

Processing incoming data
========================

Audits will be performed for:
  - Valid date line
  - Valid file link
  - Well-formed data within the spreadsheet

After the audits are passed, a generated reply will be made to the "Order
History Data" topic, consisting of a copy of the accepted post from the
"Post completed daily orders" topic.

Processing order history data
=============================

Once a day, new replies in the "Order History Data" topic will be
processed and an order history spreadsheet will be created with the
following columns:

    ID,Orders,First Order Date,Last Order Date

There is one row per consumer, which has a total of all orders ever made by that consumer.

The first reply in the "Order History" topic is then updated with this spreadsheet.

The first row of the spreadsheet is special, using the ID of 0, and
the Last Order Data column to encode the date of the newest processed
completed daily orders spreadsheet.

Data coherency and processing optimizations
===========================================

It becomes linearly more expensive each day to process all of the historical data,
downloading/parsing every completed daily workflow spreadsheet. To avoid/minimize
this effect and to maintain data coherency, the "Order History Data" processing:

  - Stores the post number of the last processed "Order History Data" reply
    in the "Order History Data" topic post. This is used as a first filter
    to limit the processing to newly posted spreadsheets.
  - Always processes spreadsheets in date order; oldest to newest.
  - Builds a sorted, unique list of all spreadsheets in the posts. With duplicates,
    the latest post wins.
  - Finds the oldest spreadsheet date for unprocessed "Order History Data" posts.
  - If the oldest, unprocessed spreadsheet date is newer than the date in the
    previous "Order History" spreadsheet, the unprocessed spreadsheets are merged
    with the previous "Order History" spreadsheet, avoiding the need to download
    any previously processed data.
  - If the oldest, unprocessed spreadsheet date is older than the date in the
    previous "Order History" spreadsheet, the "Order History" spreadsheet is
    generated from the beginning.

Note that this eliminates the need for the previously used manual reset mechanism
described in the "Order History" topic post.
